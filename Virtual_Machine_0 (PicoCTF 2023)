We are presented with a dea file that we can view online, The 3D render is a black box with 2 gears, 1 with 40 teeth and another with 8 teeth

we are also given an input value and we are told that with that input we will be able to acquire the key which will be the output

to find the gear ratio we just divide the big gear by the small gear. its a 5:1 ratio

using the input we can multiply it by 5 and ubtain quit a long number.

Using a python script written but we can switch the number to a hex value and then turn that into ASCII and aquire the key 

spins = input

result = 5 * spins

print(hex(result))

print(bytes.fromhex(hex(result)[2:]))
