#Specialer

1. Were given a bash terminal thats been stripped of most common commands like ls and clear however we can still use cd

2. we can take advantage of this by writing cd and pressing tab to show the files in the directory and esentially serve as a discount ls'

3. we do this and nacigate through the directories and see there a various .txt files but we cant use cat so we have so we have to find an alternative

4. after some research i found that you can use echo to read the contents of a file by doing echo "$(<file.txt)" and this will work basically the same way cat does

5. we do this for a few files until we find the flag.
