#Special

1. were given a "special" terminal that has an autocorrect feature implemented into it which makes it basically impossible to run most commands

2. commands that are normally written as full words like clear dont work because the first letter becomes capitilized but we can get them to work but writing 2 commands in one line: Clear ; clear

3. after digging in we can see that the server were on has python

4. using the os library we can create a very small script that lets us basically run bash commands through python

5. we import os and do os.system("ls")

6. we can use this same approach with all other bash commands to move through the directories and read the flag.txt file
