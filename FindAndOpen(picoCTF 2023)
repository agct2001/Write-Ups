#Find And Open

1. this challenge provides us with 2 files, 1 which requires a password to open and another file which is a dump.

2. if we cat the dump file well see a big wall of text with some cryptic messages through it that hint and what must be done

3. if we look closey we can see theres a base64 encoded string, decoping it will give us half of the flag

4. we can use this first half of the flag ass the password for the other file and this will provide us with the full flag.
